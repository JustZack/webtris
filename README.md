Web based Tetris, with the goal of emulating gameplay of 1989 NES Tetris as closely as possible with some fun features.
1. Allow for every game rule / setting to be changed (Board size / Block Sizes / Colors / Speed / Cheats)
2. Allow for using different sets of pieces
3. Controller support

# Big Ideas
* User system with user tracking and configuration (High scores, stats, settings)
* Replay system + Resume from specific game frame
* Multiplayer realtime (one or many boards) and turn based games (think words w/friends)
* Playing against AI (Either an algorithm or seeting if an AI Agent can generate instructions)
